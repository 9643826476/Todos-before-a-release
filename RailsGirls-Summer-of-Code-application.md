## Project Description

Nextcloud is an open source system for file sync & sharing, calendar, contacts etc. Very similar to what Dropbox or Google Suite are used for. It consists of a server component with apps for Files, Contacts, Calendar, Mail, Video/voice chat etc., a desktop client, and mobile apps for Android and iOS.


## Project's Requirements

The server part is mainly programmed in Javascript with Vue.js, PHP, HTML and CSS. The Android app is Java, the iOS app in Objective-C, and the desktop app in C++ and Qt.

There are a lot of different aspects to work on in Nextcloud so thereâ€™s something fitting for everyone. For example:

Server apps:
- The main server component: https://github.com/nextcloud/server
- Voice/video chat: https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed
- Calendar: https://github.com/nextcloud/calendar
- Contacts: https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts
- Mail: https://github.com/nextcloud/mail

The mobile & desktop apps:
- Android: https://github.com/nextcloud/android
- iOS: https://github.com/nextcloud/ios
- Desktop: https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop
