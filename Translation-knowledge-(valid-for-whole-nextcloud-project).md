# Nextcloud is available in many languages. How is that done?
Instead of maintaining an own translation server like pootle Nextcloud is using Transifex to achieve translation in many languages.
Transifex offers free service for open source projects.

Just create an account and apply to join Nextcloud organization.

Once you joined our organization you can apply to join your target language. There are already more than 70 languages available. Feel free to request a new one if your native language is missing.

# General information about Transifex
## How to discuss at Transifex?

You can discuss for each string. Who ever reads it can respond. There is no way to subscribe to any discussion as long as somebody marks discussion as issue.

For language teams there is a chance to discuss as well. It is not easy to find at web UI and not many people responding (german team experience with more than 100 members)

You could send private message to other members. Inbox and outbox are separate and there is no option to see threaded messages. You cannot invite third person to private discussions.

# Information for Project Maintainers
## How to handle new language requests?

Nextcloud want to cover the world. To reach this target we need to provide as many languages as we can get.
Luckily every week we get new language requests. Great. But do not simply accept it. 
Please check if similar languages are already there. If so, check the team size and send a personal message to language requester. Tell him/her about the language you found, provide link to team and ask her/him to join named team.

What happens if we accept all language requests?

We have a lot of languages. The no. will be impressive, but the state of completeness is low and quality might be as well.
