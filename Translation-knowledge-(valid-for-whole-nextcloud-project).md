# Nextcloud is available in many languages. How is that done?
Instead of maintaining an own translation server like pootle Nextcloud is using Transifex to achieve translation in many languages.
Transifex offers free service for open source projects.

Just create an account and apply to join Nextcloud organization.

Once you joined our organization you can apply to join your target language. There are already more than 70 languages available. Feel free to request a new one if your native language is missing.
