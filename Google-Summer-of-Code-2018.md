Check the [offical GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) page for general information such as schedule and requirements to participate in the program.

We have applied: more information on February 12th!

## Tips
We will prefer students who have shown to have the skills needed to contribute to Nextcloud. That means - if you've successfully managed to do an issue labeled with [good first issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) , bugfix or other minor change to Nextcloud and have gone through the process of integrating this at least once, we will know you've got a development setup and are capable of working with our process. We thus suggest to get started at https://nextcloud.com/contribute/
