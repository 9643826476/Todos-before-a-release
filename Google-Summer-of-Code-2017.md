Check the [offical GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) page for general information such as schedule and requirements to participate in the program.

## Tips
We will prefer students who have shown to have the skills needed to contribute to Nextcloud. That means - if you've successfully managed to do a junior job, bugfix or other minor change to Nextcloud and have gone through the process of integrating this at least once, we will know you've got a development setup and are capable of working with our process. We thus suggest to get started at https://nextcloud.com/contribute/

## Project Ideas
Here we'd like to put a list of projects we suggest (GSoC projects are restricted to coding): 

### Android
* Make the Android app Great Again for the First Time

### Server
* Make the Server Great Again for the First Time

### iOS

### Apps

**__We do want to encouraged you to come up with your own project ideas and discuss them with potential mentors. Please join us on IRC or on our [forums](https://help.nextcloud.com) to discuss ideas.__**
