Check the [offical GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) page for general information such as schedule and requirements to participate in the program.

We participate this year through openSUSE - thanks to the Geekos ;-)
See their site: http://101.opensuse.org/gsoc/

## Tips
We will prefer students who have shown to have the skills needed to contribute to Nextcloud. That means - if you've successfully managed to do a junior job, bugfix or other minor change to Nextcloud and have gone through the process of integrating this at least once, we will know you've got a development setup and are capable of working with our process. We thus suggest to get started at https://nextcloud.com/contribute/

## Project Ideas
Here we'd like to put a list of projects we suggest (GSoC projects are restricted to coding): 

### Desktop
* Desktop sync client in Python and QT (Mentor: [@mario](https://github.com/mario))
* Integration of provider selection in Desktop Sync Client so openSUSE (and other distro's) get an out-of-the-box cloud experience (optional: integration in YaST). (Mentors: [@rullzer](https://github.com/rullzer) [@tcanabrava](https://github.com/tcanabrava) and the YaST team)

### Server
* User data export/migration (similar to Google Takeout)
* Federated sharing for calendars/contacts [Issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/1440)
* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) integration (Distributed, P2P backups with a CDN-like benefit. [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ), [Github issue]( https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/385 ) and [forum thread](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/p2p-seeded-file-sync/277/9 ))
* CI: Automated performance measurements and comparison (could perhaps use [openQA](https://openqa.opensuse.org))
* integration of easy Nextcloud server setup in YaST

### Android
* See many [ideas in github](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)

### iOS
* See many [ideas in github](https://github.com/nextcloud/ios/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)

### Apps
* Unify keyboard controls in files, contacts, calendar, etc: [#1444](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/1444) (Mentor: [@eppfel](https://epp.design))
* [ðŸ“ž Video calls / Spreed](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed) (Mentor: [@nickvergessen](https://github.com/nickvergessen))
* Work on server apps: Passman, Gallery, Mail, ...
* Extending PHP XMPP server from [chat (JSXC)](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc.nextcloud)

### Other
* Automated builds of clients matching settings of the theming app
* QA testing platform [forum thread](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/grow-the-qa-team-and-offer-tools-for-end-users/323/3) (can use openQA)

**__We do want to encourage you to come up with your own project ideas and discuss them with potential mentors. Please join us on IRC or on our [forums](https://help.nextcloud.com) to discuss ideas.__**
