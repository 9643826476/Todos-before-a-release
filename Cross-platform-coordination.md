## Better coordination & communication among our different platforms
- We need to make sure to coordinate among [‚òÅ server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/), [ü§ñ Android](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/), [üçè iOS](https://github.com/nextcloud/ios/) & [üíª desktop](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/).
- New features should be centrally discussed in the [server repository](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/). (For example the updated share flow, or the QR code to sign in ‚Üí they are all related to all platforms.)
- Get people from desktop and mobile involved directly because the web interface should follow patterns which apply to mobile & desktop too. @-mention [@nextcloud/desktop](https://github.com/orgs/nextcloud/teams/desktop/members) [@nextcloud/android](https://github.com/orgs/nextcloud/teams/android/members) [@nextcloud/ios](https://github.com/orgs/nextcloud/teams/ios/members)
- Mobile and desktop people can add the issue to their relevant project boards. (Issues can be assigned to multiple projects).
- We use issue tags "[client: ü§ñüçè mobile](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/labels/client%3A%20%F0%9F%A4%96%F0%9F%8D%8F%20mobile)" and "[client: üíª desktop](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/labels/client%3A%20%F0%9F%92%BB%20desktop)" in the server repository these cross-platform issues.

All issues are labeled "overview" and "client: :computer: desktop" and "client: :robot::green_apple: mobile" and can be found [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22client%3A+%F0%9F%A4%96%F0%9F%8D%8F+mobile%22+label%3A%22client%3A+%F0%9F%92%BB+desktop%22)
